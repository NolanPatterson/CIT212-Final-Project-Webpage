            <p>Welcome to my web design journey at IUPUI! Over the course of 16 weeks, I embarked on an educational adventure, learning the ins and outs of website design. This platform showcases the skills, techniques, and knowledge I've gained during my time with Professor Kane in CIT-212.</p>
            <p>Our journey began with learning the fundamentals of HTML tags and getting acquainted with GitHub. As we progressed into the second week, we dove into the world of CSS, followed by positioning and semantic tags in week three. Week four introduced us to the Holy Grail layout, paving the way for a fun and collaborative group project in week five, where we designed Pok√©mon cards.</p>
            <p>As we approached the midterm, we learned about external styling and hyperlinks, and experimented with Pinterest-style pins. Our midterm project, titled "INDY EATS," demonstrated our ability to apply the concepts we'd learned so far. Following the midterm, we tackled media queries and responsive webpages, as well as cybersecurity considerations in web design.</p>
            <p>In the final stretch of the course, we explored modern layout techniques, including grid layouts, flexbox, and flip cards. To wrap up our journey, we were introduced to the basics of JavaScript, adding interactivity to our web projects.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore the various projects showcased on this website, which reflect the progress and skills acquired during my web design class at IUPUI. Enjoy the journey!</p>
