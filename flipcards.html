                        <p>This was our first project, and it was also the first thing I had ever uploaded to Github. For this project, I demonstrated how to use header, paragraph, and list tags. I also included an optional hyperlink.</p>

                        <p>For this project, we designed a webpage inspired by IU news. This was the first project that used an external style sheet.

                        <p>This assignment taught us how to use the holy grail layout and z-index. We also learned how to use the positioning property in CSS. To complete the project, I used fixed, relative, and absolute positioning. I applied my choice of colors and styling.</p>

                        <p>For this project, we created a prototype web suite for the Indianapolis Food Fair. We used a provided wireframe to create a landing page for different food categories. I then chose my own food categories and images for the other pages. I learned how to use an image as a hyperlink for this project.</p>

                        <p>This was our first project using flexbox and media queries. We used supplied images, basic HTML, and style specs. We then wrote the CSS needed to match the styling specs and media queries with two breakpoints. The result was ugly, as intended, but a great learning experience. Flexbox is definitely better than manual positioning!</p>

I really appreciated the opportunity to make a project using my prefered styling and ideas. I made a landing page, a red team page, and a blue team page. I used flexbox to make the pages responsive.</p>

                        <p>For this project, I made a three page layout with an off grid living theme. We learned how to use the grid styling in CSS. I used grid for the layout and flexbox for some content. I used Adobe color wheel to find a color theme, and populated the content using a provided website for inspiration. Using grid, flexbox, and media queries made the pages responsive.</p>

                        <p>For this project, I created a spring themed page using flex cards. The webpage had six cards that used images from my garden in Spring. I used appropriate colors from Adobe color wheel, box shadowing, and hover effects for a great spring style. Clicking the cards takes you to sites where you can learn more about the plants in my garden. The flex cards and images were also made responsive to browser resizing.</p>

                        <p>This was a similar project to "Signs of Spring", but I chose a breakfast theme for this one. I used the color theme from CrackerBarrel. Then I searched for healthy breakfast items and images. I like all these breakfast items except shredded wheat. Yuck! Clicking the cards takes you to sites where you can learn more about the item. The flex cards and images were also made responsive to browser resizing.</p>

I used vivid images to draw attention to the cars, and included info and links to my favorite cars. Like the other projects the page was responsive using flexbox and media queries. </p>
