                <br>
                <p>As a passionate cybersecurity and information assurance enthusiast, I earned my associate's degree from Ivy Tech Community College before embarking on my journey towards a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity at IUPUI. With no prior background in web design, I took my first web design course as a prerequisite for my degree program, and it quickly became a newfound passion. My interest in HTML and CSS grew as I explored the creative possibilities they offer, blending seamlessly with my technical background.</p>
                <p>Throughout the course, I enjoyed every project, especially the group assignments that allowed for collaboration and exchange of ideas. The opportunity to experiment with various styles and discover new techniques online ignited a creative spark, driving me to delve deeper into the world of web design. One of the most fulfilling aspects of this experience has been the ability to express my creativity while expanding my technical skillset.</p>
                <p>As I continue to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, my aspirations in web design have evolved. I aim to launch my own blog, where I can create and share content that reflects my interests and expertise. Combining my passion for cybersecurity and web design, I hope to pursue a fulfilling career in IT or cybersecurity, leveraging the skills I've acquired in both fields.</p>
